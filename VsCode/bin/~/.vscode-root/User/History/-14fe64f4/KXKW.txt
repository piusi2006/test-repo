# Here are some optional features that can be configured in your ansible environment. Some features can be seen as imperative.
1. 'Ansible-vault' - A mechanism for encryption & decryption of sensitive data using passwords. Here's how you encrypt a variable and a file:

To encrypt a variable:
First, create your vault file which will house your vault passwords:
- "ansible-vault create 'filename.yml'". Ensure that you are in the current directory where you want the file stored OR you can enter the Path.
Then, enter:
'ansible-vault encrypt_string <password_source> '<string_to_encrypt>' --name '<string_name_of_variable>''
- vault password source = A prompt, file, or script, with or without a vault ID.
- string to encrypt = The variable in string format that you want to encrypt.
- string name = Name of the variable for e.g. 'ansible_password'


'ansible-playbook --extra-vars @secrets.enc --vault-password-file secrets.pass'
